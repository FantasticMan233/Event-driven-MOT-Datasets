The original shapes_6dof dataset is proposed in [1]. based on data provided in [1], For the application of multi-object tracking, we have conducted semi-automatic annotation for each frame the dataset, which users can find under the directory 'images' and its subdirectories. We have also generated ground truth files in a format similar to the MOTChallenge: 'gt.txt', to facilitate the calculation of tracking accuracy. The 'event.txt' file is the event list file, where each line represents an event, denoted as "timestamp (in seconds) x y p", and the 'frame.txt' file specifies the start time for each frame of the image.
